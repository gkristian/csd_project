#If a line starts with a # it is considered a comment
#Read tester weights
#Each line specifies a link so e.g. below is a gneral format
#src-dst:link_util,packet_drops
#Example: below line assign a link_util_value of 80 and packet_drop value of 0 to link from dpid 21 to dpid 23
#21-23:80,0
#if packet drop is set to 0, and in cpm all modules except CPM_TESTER is disable, then link_util becomes the weight of the link in topology that CPM uses to compute shortest paths.
