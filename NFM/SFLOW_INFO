Run sflow in one terminal:

shell script file "run_sflow.sh" which will run "testSFlow2.py" code.

That sflow code will listen on port 6343 for sflow information




Start mininet on another terminal:

basic,  sudo mn --controller=remote,ip=127.0.0.1

open s1 on xterm and input command:

ovs-vsctl -- --id=@sflow create sflow agent=eth0 target=\"127.0.0.1:6343\" header=128
sampling=10 polling=20 -- set bridge s1 sflow=@sflow


this will enable sflow agent on s1 which will send sflow information to target (ryu collector, testSFlow2.py")





Current state is that we can retrieve different information about sflow,
have some conditions in the code that will print depending on type of object that sflow contains.


TODO

Understand that information, compare with current NFM. Is the sflow retrieved 
significant or is it useless data.
